            üëã Hey there! I'm Vansh, a software engineer who genuinely enjoys the puzzle-solving aspect of building systems and writing code. Over the past few years, I've had the opportunity to work with backend technologies, distributed systems, and AI - experiences that have taught me a lot about creating reliable software that people actually use.
          </p>

          <p>
            üõ†Ô∏è I find myself drawn to challenges involving performance optimization and system design. Whether it's working with Java and Spring Boot for robust backend services, experimenting with Go for concurrent systems, or exploring AI and LLMs through Python, I'm always curious about how different tools can solve different problems.
          </p>

          <p>
            ‚ö° When I'm not coding, I'm usually exploring new technologies or working on side projects that hopefully make things a bit easier for someone out there. I also enjoy staying active through football and combat sports, listening to music, and spending time with furry friends - dogs, cats, and rabbits all have a special place in my heart.
          </p>
          <!-- <p>
            üòÉI'm a passionate software developer with expertise in building modern web applications and digital experiences. 
            My journey in technology began with a curiosity about how things work, which led me to pursue a career in software development.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I specialize in JavaScript ecosystems, with a focus on modern frameworks and technologies.
