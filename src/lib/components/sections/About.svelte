            üëã Hey there! I‚Äôm Vansh Pratap Singh, a software engineer who loves building scalable systems and solving tough problems with code. Over the last few years, I‚Äôve worked across backend, distributed systems, and AI, shipping features that serve tens of thousands of users in real time, optimizing microservices for 4x throughput, and even cutting operational costs by 60%.
          </p>

          <p>
            üöÄ From winning company hackathons üèÜ to being recognized with awards for technical excellence, I enjoy creating impactful solutions that blend performance, reliability, and innovation. I‚Äôm equally at home designing high-scale backend architectures with Java, Spring Boot, and Go as I am experimenting with AI/LLMs, Prompt Engineering, and Python.
          </p>

          <p>
            ‚ö° Outside of work, I‚Äôm always exploring new technologies (currently diving deeper into Rust :p) and love working on projects that push boundaries and make life a little easier for people. I like keeping healthy & also love football, combat sports, music, dogs, cats & rabbits.
          </p>

            My journey in technology began with a curiosity about how things work, which led me to pursue a career in software development.
          </p>
