It offers several advantages:</p><ul><li><strong>Performance</strong>: Svelte compiles your code to highly efficient JavaScript that directly updates the DOM.</li><li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Straightforward syntax that feels like writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li><li><strong>Server-side rendering</strong>: Built-in support for SSR improves SEO and initial page load times.</li><li><strong>Progressive enhancement</strong>: Works even if JavaScript is disabled.</li><li><strong>Filesystem-based routing</strong>: Intuitive routing that maps directly to your project structure.</li></ul><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>Creating a new SvelteKit project is as simple as running:</p><pre><code>npm create svelte@latest my-app</code></pre><p>This interactive command allows you to choose the features you want in your project, including TypeScript support, ESLint, Prettier, and more.</p><!-- more content here -->"
